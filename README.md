Diabetes Prediction and Classification
A machine learning model using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a test accuracy of 97%.

Overview
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and intervention can significantly improve the management of diabetes and reduce its complications. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of diabetes based on various health parameters.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains anonymized health data, including demographic information, medical history, and various physiological measurements such as blood pressure, glucose levels, and BMI.

Project Structure
data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
models: Saved trained models.
src: Source code for the project, including scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and correlations.
Model Selection: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing model to optimize performance.
Deployment: Once satisfied with the model performance, deploy it for real-world use.
Model
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): A type of artificial neural network used for predictive modeling. The MLP achieved a test accuracy of 97% in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes.
